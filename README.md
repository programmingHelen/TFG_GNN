# Graph Neural Network Architectures

Explore and implement cutting-edge Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures with our repository, showcasing Graph Attention Networks (GAT), GraphSAGE, and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). This project is built upon the foundation provided by the [GCN-GAT-and-Graphsage](https://github.com/MrLeeeee/GCN-GAT-and-Graphsage/tree/master) repository.

## Data Folder
**What's Inside:**
- Datasets: All required datasets for simulations and raw JSON files from Deezer.
- `Dataset.py`: Comprehensive preprocessing functions for datasets.
- `Deezer reader.ipynb`: An auxiliary notebook for converting JSON and CSV files to `.content` and `.cites` formats.

## Models Folder
Contains architecture files in `.py` extension, each with specific layers:
- `BasicModel.py`
- `Graphsage.py`
- `PyGAT.py`
- `PyGCN.py`
- `__init__.py`

## Utilization
1. Ensure compatibility by checking `requirements.txt` for library versions.
2. Execute `main.ipynb`, where you can select your preferred dataset and models.
